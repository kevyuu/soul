/// Base interface for readers and writers.
///
/// Readers and writers are an abstraction of plain byte oriented data access to files or network
/// streamed data. They separate the data access from the data parsing and formatting.
///
/// Readers and writers can have certain capabilities. The capabilities are hierarchical, meaning
/// that if a capability is supported, all capabilities above it are supported as well. Possible
/// capabilities are:
///
/// - Streaming: The minimal capability is sequential unbuffered reading or writing of data,
///   suitable for streaming or stdin/stdout usage.
///
/// - Lookahead: Applicable to readers only, lookahead gives access to a flexible, but maybe limited
///   amount of data in the input stream that has not been read yet. It is usually a byproduct of
///   buffering or random access, where after reading of the lookahead the read position is reset to
///   the position before the lookahead. It can be used for examining a file for a magic header that
///   identifies the file format.
///
/// - Random recorded access: The reader or writer is capable of jumping to a position that has
///   previously been recorded. The recorded position uses an opaque representation of a position
///   in a stream.
///
/// - Random absolute access: The reader or writer is capable of jumping to an absolute position
///   indexed from the beginning of the stream.
///
/// The different capabilities are not expressed in a class hierarchy but in query functions and
/// well-defined behavior of all API functions for all capabilities.
///
/// Readers and writers are exposed as three interfaces to the importers and exporters:
/// #mi::neuraylib::IReader_writer_base (this interface), #mi::neuraylib::IReader and
/// #mi::neuraylib::IWriter, where the latter two derive from the first.
///
/// Readers and writers operate in binary mode only. They do not perform any automatic conversions,
/// for example, such as newline to CR/LF for text mode files on Windows. If you require such
/// conversions for a specific file format, you need to add the necessary control sequences yourself
/// and have your parser accept them correctly.
///
/// Read and write sizes, as well as seek and tell positions, are consistently #mi::Sint64 types. It
/// is a signed integer since some functions will use -1 as error indicator. Note: On 32 bit
/// machines, all #mi::Sint64 sizes are limited to 32 bits and thus file sizes to 4 GB.
///
/// The #mi::neuraylib::IReader_writer_base class deals with the common part between reader and
/// writer classes. This includes random access functions, access to an optionally available file
/// descriptor, and handling of error and end-of-file conditions. The file descriptor is provided to
/// support 3rd party libraries that require a file descriptor. It may not be available for all
/// readers/writers.
