/// A compiled material is a canonical representation of a material instance including all its

/// are folded into one expression and common subexpressions are identified (denoted as \em
/// temporaries here).
///
/// Note that there are two modes to create compiled materials: instance compilation and class
/// compilation. In instance compilation mode all arguments of the material instance, i.e., the
/// constants and calls, are folded and the result is an expression without any references to
/// arguments anymore. In class compilation mode only the calls are folded and the result is an
/// expression where the constant arguments of the material instance are represented by symbolic
/// placeholders. The class compilation mode allows to share the compiled representation for
/// materials if they are structurally equivalent (the call structure is similar) and only the value
/// arguments differ.
///
/// The expression that represents the compiled material consists of constant values, results of
/// function calls, indices of temporaries, or indices of arguments. Constant values are represented
/// by expressions of the kind #mi::neuraylib::IExpression_constant. Function calls are represented
/// by expressions of the kind #mi::neuraylib::IExpression_direct_call. References to temporaries
/// are represented by expressions of the kind #mi::neuraylib::IExpression_temporary, whose value is
/// the index into the array of temporaries. References to arguments appear only in case of class
/// compilation. In this case they are represented by expressions of the kind
/// #mi::neuraylib::IExpression_parameter, whose value is the index into the array of arguments.
